# E-Space: Campus Digital Engagement Platform

A team-developed web application designed to centralize campus events and encourage meaningful student engagement.

---

## Overview

Campus events are often distributed across multiple platforms, making discovery inefficient and participation inconsistent. Despite the abundance of opportunities, students may still feel disconnected due to fragmented information and high participation friction.

E-Space addresses this gap by creating a unified digital space where students can:

- Discover campus events easily
- Create and manage events
- Engage through a lightweight participation metric (“E-Score”)

The platform focuses on reducing friction and reinforcing presence rather than competition.

---

## Team Project Context

E-Space was developed as a collaborative team project.

Each team member contributed to product ideation, feature planning, and system design.  
This repository highlights the front-end implementation and engagement logic components that I personally developed.

# E-Space: Campus Digital Engagement Platform

A team-developed web application designed to centralize campus events and encourage meaningful student engagement.

---

## Overview

E-Space addresses the fragmentation of campus event information by providing a unified digital platform for event discovery and participation.

The platform reduces participation friction and introduces a lightweight engagement metric (“E-Score”) to reinforce presence and involvement without competitive pressure.

## Team Context

This project was developed collaboratively as a team initiative.

This repository highlights the front-end architecture and engagement logic components that I personally implemented.

## My Contribution

I was responsible for:

- Front-end architecture and UI implementation  
- Login validation and interactive form logic  
- Event creation workflow and client-side validation  
- E-Score engagement interaction design  
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS

## Core Features

- Centralized event discovery  
- Secure campus login interface  
- Structured event creation system  
- Engagement-based E-Score mechanism  

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- LocalStorage

## Design Philosophy

E-Space is built around three principles:

- **Accessibility** – Lower the barrier to participation  
- **Clarity** – Reduce fragmentation in event information  
- **Positive Reinforcement** – Encourage presence rather than competition  

Technology should function as a bridge for connection, not an additional source of pressure.
